### What is all this?

Part of the requirements of [Forrest Brazeal's Cloud Resume Challenge](https://forrestbrazeal.com/2020/04/23/the-cloud-resume-challenge/) is to keep a blog documenting the process. The requirements are to host a static HTML resume on AWS, while displaying skills in full-stack devlopment, version control, infrastructure as code, automation, CI/CD, cloud services and serverless, application security, and networking.

### When?

My focus is currently on getting AWS Certified, so most of my time is dedicated to self-study. I'm also on a Cloud/DevOps roadmap, and learning the associated tools is my priority. So there is no deadline with this project, and it's certainly not a crash course.

### Why?

- To learn by doing

- As part of [#100DaysOfCloud](https://www.100daysofcloud.com/) - putting new cloud skills into practice on days off

### How?

I've split the requirements of the project up into three phases:

- Phase 1: Create HTML resume
- Phase 2: Deploy HTML resume on AWS
- Phase 3: Set up CI/CD
